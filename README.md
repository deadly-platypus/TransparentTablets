TransparentTablets
==================

This is my final project for the Spring 2014 CS 434 class at Purdue University.  It is going to attempt to make the screen of a tablet appear as if it was transparent.  There are a lot of assumptions going into this initial attempt, namely: 

* The relative position of the tablet and the user remains unchanged (so no head-tracking just yet).
* Only walls will be looked at.
* The user is initially looking directly at the wall when the app starts.
